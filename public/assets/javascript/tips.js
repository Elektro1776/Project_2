{tip: "For Loops: The for statement creates a loop that consists of three optional expressions, enclosed in parentheses and separated by semicolons, followed by a statement (usually a block statement) to be executed in the loop. You can write a basic For loop to cycle through data as in this example:  var someArray = [2, 4, 6, 8] for (var i = 0; i < someArray.length; i++) {var x = i + 3; console,log(x);}; The result would be 5, 7, 9, 11", link: "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for"},
